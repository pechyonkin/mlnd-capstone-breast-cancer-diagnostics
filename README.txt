In order to make it work just open the notebook and do all imports. All functionality that I wrote is in the folder ./code/

The data file is in the folder ./data/

I inluded ./tex/ folder to show how I wrote and compiled the final report.

All the names of folders there are self-explanatory so I do not feel that much explanation is needed.
